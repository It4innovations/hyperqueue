# Tako

Tako is a framework for running computations on a cluster computer.
Tako is derived from our previous work on https://github.com/It4innovations/rsds 
by stripping down Dask-related parts and making the core more generic. 

Tako is a backend library for "tool builders" and is not intended to be directly used by end-users.

## Local development
