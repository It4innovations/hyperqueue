**HyperQueue** is a tool designed to simplify execution of large workflows (task graphs) on HPC clusters. It allows you
to execute a large number of tasks in a simple way, without having to manually submit jobs into batch schedulers like
Slurm or PBS. You specify what you want to compute and HyperQueue automatically asks for computational resources
and dynamically load-balances tasks across all allocated nodes and resources. HyperQueue can also work without Slurm/PBS
as a general distributed task execution engine.

This image shows how HyperQueue can work on a distributed cluster that uses Slurm or PBS:

## Features

- **Complex resource management**
    - Load balancing of tasks across all available (HPC) resources
    - Automatic submission of Slurm/PBS jobs on behalf of the user
    - Complex and arbitrary task resource requirements (# of cores, GPUs, memory, FPGAs, ...)
      - Non-fungible resources (tasks are assigned specific resources, e.g. a GPU with ID `1`)
      - Fractional resources (tasks can require e.g. `0.5` of a GPU)
      - Resource variants (tasks can require e.g. `1 GPU and 4 CPU cores` OR `16 CPU cores`)
      - Related resources (tasks can require e.g. `4 CPU cores in the same NUMA node`)

- **High performance**
    - Scales to hundreds of nodes/workers and millions of tasks
    - Overhead per one task is below `0.1ms`
    - Allows streaming of stdout/stderr from tasks to avoid creating many small files on distributed filesystems

- **Simple user interface**
    - Task graphs can be defined via a CLI, TOML workflow files or a Python API
    - Cluster utilization can be monitored with a real-time dashboard

- **Easy deployment**
    - Provided as a single, statically linked binary without any runtime dependencies (apart from `libc`)
    - No admin access to a cluster is needed for its usage

## Installation

* Download the latest binary distribution from this [link](https://github.com/It4innovations/hyperqueue/releases/latest).
* Unpack the downloaded archive:

  ```bash
  $ tar -xvzf hq-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz
  ```

* That's it! Just use the unpacked `hq` binary.

> If you want to try the newest features, you can also download a nightly
> [build](https://github.com/It4innovations/hyperqueue/releases/nightly).

## Submitting a simple task

* Start a server (e.g. on a login node, a cluster partition, or simply on your PC)

  ```bash
  $ hq server start &
  ```
* Submit a job (command ``echo 'Hello world'`` in this case)

  ```bash
  $ hq submit echo 'Hello world'
  ```
* Ask for computing resources

    * Either start a worker manually

      ```bash
      $ hq worker start &
      ```

    * Or configure automatic submission of workers into PBS/SLURM

      - PBS:

        ```bash
        $ hq alloc add pbs --time-limit 1h -- -q <queue>
        ```
      - Slurm:

        ```bash
        $ hq alloc add slurm --time-limit 1h -- -p <partition>
        ```

* See the result of the job once it finishes

  ```bash
  $ hq job wait last
  $ hq job cat last stdout
  ```
