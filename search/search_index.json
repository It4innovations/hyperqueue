It dynamically groups jobs into SLURM/PBS jobs and distributes them to fully utilize allocated notes. You thus do not have to manually aggregate your tasks into SLURM/PBS jobs.

It is not necessary to be able to connect from server to computing nodes. In the most simple scenario, we expect that the user starts its own instance of HyperQueue directly on login of a HPC system. The server can be simply started by the following command: hq server start Note: The server opens two TCP/IP ports: one for submitting jobs and one for connecting workers. By default, these ports are automatically assigned by the operation system. A user does not remmber them, they are stored in the \"server directory\". Other components automatically reads these settings. Server directory # When a HQ server is started, it creates a server directory where it stores informations needed for submiting jobs and connecting workers. Important: Encryption keys are stored in the server directory. Who has access to server directory may submit jobs, connect workers to HyperQueue instance, and decrypt communication between HyperQueue components. By default, server directory is stored in $HOME/.hq-server . It may be changed via option --server-dir=<PATH> . In such case, all commands need to use the --server-dir settings. You can run more instances of HyperQueue under the same user. All you need is to set a different server directories for each instance.
