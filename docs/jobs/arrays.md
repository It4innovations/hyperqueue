It is a common use case to execute the same command for multiple input parameters, for example:

- Performing a simulation for each input file in a directory
- Training many machine learning models using *hyperparameter search*

HyperQueue allows you to do this using a [job](jobs.md) containing many tasks. We call such jobs **Task arrays**. You
can create a task array with a single `submit` command and then manage all created tasks as a single group using its
containing job.

!!! note

    Task arrays are somewhat similar to "job arrays" used by PBS and Slurm. However, *HQ* **does not** use PBS/Slurm job
    arrays for implementing this feature. Therefore, the limits that are commonly enforced on job arrays on HPC clusters
    do not apply to HyperQueue task arrays.

## Creating task arrays
To create a task array, you must provide some **source** that will determine how many tasks should be created and what
environment variables should be passed to each task so that you can differentiate them.

Currently, you can create a task array from a [range of integers](#integer-range), from [each line](#lines-of-a-file)
of a text file or from each item of a [JSON array](#json-array). You cannot combine these sources, as they are mutually
exclusive.

!!! tip "Handling many output files"

    By default, each task in a task array will create two output files (containing `stdout` and `stderr` output). Creating
    large task arrays will thus generate a lot of files, which can be problematic especially on network-based shared
    filesystems, such as Lustre. To avoid this, you can either [disable](jobs.md#output) the output or use
    [**Output streaming**](streaming.md).

### Integer range
The simplest way of creating a task array is to specify an integer range. A task will be started for each integer in the
range. You can then differentiate between the individual tasks using [task id](jobs.md#identification-numbers)
that can be accessed through the `HQ_TASK_ID` [environment variable](jobs.md#environment-variables).

You can enter the range as two unsigned numbers separated by a dash[^2], where the first number should be smaller than
the second one. The range is inclusive.

[^2]: The full syntax can be seen in the second selector of the [ID selector shortcut](../cli/shortcuts.md).

The range is entered using the `--array` option:

```bash
# Task array with 3 tasks, with ids 1, 2, 3
$ hq submit --array 1-3 ...

# Task array with 6 tasks, with ids 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
$ hq submit --array 0-10:2 ...
```

### Lines of a file
Another way of creating a task array is to provide a text file with multiple lines. Each line from the file will be
passed to a separate task, which can access the value of the line using the environment variable `HQ_ENTRY`.

This is useful if you want to e.g. process each file inside some directory. You can generate a text file that will
contain each filepath on a separate line and then pass it to the submit command using the `--each-line` option:

```bash
$ hq submit --each-line entries.txt ...
```

### JSON array
You can also specify the source using a JSON array stored inside a file. HyperQueue will then create a task for each
item in the array and pass the item as a JSON string to the corresponding task using the environment variable `HQ_ENTRY`.

!!! note

    The root JSON value stored inside the file must be an array.

You can create a task array in this way using the `--from-json` option:

```bash
$ hq submit --from-json items.json ...
```
