# Python API
To provide greater flexibility and support use-cases that are difficult to express using the CLI
(such as dependencies between tasks), HyperQueue also offers a Python API for submitting complex jobs.

The documentation of the API is currently in progress.

You can find the API reference [here](apidoc).
