You can use the [`hq generate-completion <shell>`](cli:hq.generate-completion) command to generate shell completions, so that your shell can auto-complete `hq` commands.

Currently, the following shells are supported:

- `bash`
- `elvish`
- `fish`
- `powershell`
- `zsh`

Note that you will need to store the generated completions into a certain file/directory on disk, so that your shell can find them. The location of that file is shell-specific.
