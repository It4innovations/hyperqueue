**Automatic allocation** is one of the core features of HyperQueue. When you run HyperQueue on an HPC cluster, it allows
you to autonomously ask the job manager (PBS/Slurm) for computing resources and spawn HyperQueue [workers](worker.md)
on the provided nodes.

Using this mechanism, you can submit computations into HyperQueue without caring about the underlying PBS/Slurm jobs.

!!! Note "Job terminology"

    It is common to use the term "job" for jobs created by an HPC job manager, such as PBS or Slurm, which are used to
    perform computations on HPC clusters. However, HyperQueue also uses the term "job" for [ensembles of tasks](../jobs/jobs.md).

    To differentiate between these two, we will refer to jobs created by PBS or Slurm as `allocations`. We will also refer
    to PBS/Slurm as a `job manager`.

## Allocation queue
To enable automatic allocation, you have to create an `Allocation queue`. It describes a specific configuration that
will be used by HyperQueue to request computing resources from the job manager on your behalf.

Each allocation queue has a set of [parameters](#parameters). You can use them to modify the behavior of automatic
allocation, but for start you can simply use the defaults. However, you will almost certainly need to specify some
credentials to be able to ask for computing resources using PBS/Slurm.

To create a new allocation queue, use the following command and pass any required credentials (queue/partition name,
account ID, etc.) after `--`. These trailing arguments will then be passed directly to `qsub`/`sbatch`:

=== "PBS"

    ```bash
    $ hq alloc add pbs --time-limit 1h -- -qqprod -AAccount1
    ```

=== "Slurm"

    ``` bash
    $ hq alloc add slurm --time-limit 1h -- --partition=p1
    ```

!!! tip

    Make sure that a HyperQueue server is running when you execute this command. Allocation queues are not persistent,
    so you have to set them up each time you (re)start the server.

!!! warning

    Do not pass the number of nodes that should be allocated or the allocation walltime using these trailing arguments.
    These parameters are configured using other means, see [below](#parameters).

Once the queue is created, HyperQueue will start asking for allocations in order to provide computing resources
(HyperQueue workers). The exact behavior of the automatic allocation process is described [below](#behavior). You can
create multiple allocation queues, and you can even combine PBS queues with Slurm queues.

### Parameters
In addition to arguments that are passed to `qsub`/`sbatch`, you can also use several other command line options when
creating a new allocation queue:

- **`--time-limit <duration>`** Sets the walltime of created allocations[^1].

    This parameter is **required**, as HyperQueue must know the duration of the individual allocations.
    Make sure that you pass a  time limit that does not exceed the limit of the PBS/Slurm queue
    that you intend to use, otherwise the allocation submissions will fail. You can use the
    [`dry-run` command](#dry-run-command) to debug this.

- `--backlog <count>` How many allocations should be queued (waiting to be started) in PBS/Slurm at any given time.
- `--workers-per-alloc <count>` How many workers should be requested in each allocation. This corresponds
  to the number of requested nodes, as the allocator will always create a single worker per node.
- `--max-worker-count <count>` Maximum number of workers that can be queued or running in the created
  allocation queue. The amount of workers will be limited by the manager (PBS/Slurm), but you can
  use this parameter to make the limit smaller, for example if you also want to create manager allocations
  outside HyperQueue.
- **Worker resources** You can specify [CPU](../jobs/cresources.md) and [generic](../jobs/gresources.md)
  resources of workers spawned in the created allocation queue. The name and syntax of these parameters
  is the same as when you create a worker manually:

    === "PBS"
    
        ```bash
        $ hq alloc add pbs --time-limit 1h --cpus 4x4 --resource "gpus=range(1-2)" -- -qqprod -AAccount1
        ```
    
    === "Slurm"
    
        ``` bash
        $ hq alloc add slurm --time-limit 1h --cpus 4x4 --resource "gpus=range(1-2)" -- --partition=p1
        ```
    
    If you do not pass any resources, they will be detected automatically (same as it works with
    `hq worker start`).

- `--name <name>` Name of the allocation queue. Will be used to name allocations. Serves for debug purposes only.

[^1]: You can use various [shortcuts](../cli/shortcuts.md#duration) for the duration value.

## Behavior
The automatic allocator will submit allocations to make sure that there are is a specific number
of allocations waiting to be started by the job manager. This number is called **backlog** and you
can [set it](#parameters) when creating the queue.

    For example, if **backlog** was set to `4` and there is currently only one allocation queued into the job manager,
    the allocator would queue three more allocations.

    The backlog serves to pre-queue allocations, because it can take some time before the job manager
    starts them, and also as a load balancing factor, since it will allocate as many resources as the job manager allows.

    !!! note

        The **backlog** value does not limit the number of running allocations, only the number of queued allocations.

    !!! warning

        Do not set the `backlog` to a large number to avoid overloading the job manager.

When an allocation starts, a HyperQueue [worker](worker.md) will start and connect to the HyperQueue
server that queued the allocation. The worker has the [idle timeout](worker.md#idle-timeout) set to
five minutes, therefore it will terminate if it doesn't receive any new tasks for five minutes.

## Stopping automatic allocation
If you want to remove an allocation queue, use the following command:

```bash
$ hq alloc remove <queue-id>
```

When an allocation queue is removed, all its corresponding queued and running allocations will be
canceled immediately.

By default, HQ will not allow you to remove an allocation queue that contains a running allocation.
If you want to force its removal, use the `--force` flag.

When the HQ server stops, it will automatically remove all allocation queues and cleanup all
allocations.

## Debugging automatic allocation
Since the automatic allocator is a "background" process that interacts with an external job manager, it can be challenging
to debug its behavior. To aid with this process, HyperQueue provides a "dry-run" command that you can
use to test allocation parameters. HyperQueue also provides various sources of information that can help you
find out what is going on.

To mitigate the case of incorrectly entered allocation parameters, HQ will also try to submit a test
allocation (do a "dry run") into the target HPC job manager when you add a new allocation queue.
If the test allocation fails, the queue will not be created. You can avoid this behaviour by passing
the `--no-dry-run` flag to `hq alloc add`.

There are also additional safety limits. If `10` allocations in a succession fail to be submitted,
or if `3` allocations that were submitted fail during runtime in a succession, the corresponding
allocation queue will be automatically removed.

### Dry-run command
To test whether PBS/Slurm will accept the submit parameters that you provide to the auto allocator
without creating an allocation queue, you can use the `dry-run` command. It accepts the same
parameters as `hq alloc add`, which it will use to immediately submit an allocation and print
any encountered errors.

```bash
$ hq alloc dry-run pbs --timelimit 2h -- q qexp -A Project1
```

If the allocation was submitted successfully, it will be canceled immediately to avoid wasting resources.

### Finding information about allocations
- **[`Basic queue information`](#display-information-about-an-allocation-queue)** This command will
show you details about allocations created by the automatic allocator.
- **Extended logging** To get more information about what is happening inside the allocator, start the HyperQueue
[server](server.md) with the following environment variable:

    ```bash
    $ RUST_LOG=hyperqueue::server::autoalloc=debug hq server start
    ```

    The log output of the server will then contain a detailed trace of allocator actions.

- **Allocation files** Each time the allocator queues an allocation into the job manager, it will write the submitted
bash script, allocation ID and `stdout` and `stderr` of the allocation to disk. You can find these files inside the
server directory:

    ```bash
    $ ls <hq-server-dir>/hq-current/autoalloc/<queue-id>/<allocation-num>/
    stderr
    stdout
    job-id
    hq-submit.sh
    ```

## Useful autoalloc commands
Here is a list of useful commands to manage automatic allocation:

### Display a list of all allocation queues
```bash
$ hq alloc list
```

### Display information about an allocation queue
```bash
$ hq alloc info <queue-id>
```

You can filter allocations by their state (`queued`, `running`, `finished`, `failed`) using the `--filter` option.
