**HyperQueue** lets you build a computation plan consisting of a large amount of tasks and then
execute it transparently over a system like SLURM/PBS. It dynamically groups jobs into SLURM/PBS jobs and distributes
them to fully utilize allocated notes. You thus do not have to manually aggregate your tasks into SLURM/PBS jobs.

## Submiting a simple task

* Start server (e.g. on a login node or in a cluster partition)

  ``$ hq server start &``

* Submit a job (command ``echo 'Hello world'`` in this case)

  ``$ hq submit echo 'Hello world'``

* Ask for computing resources

    * Start worker manually

      ``$ hq worker start &``

    * Manual request in PBS

      - Start worker on the first node of a PBS job

        ``$ qsub <your-params-of-qsub> -- hq worker start``

      - Start worker on all nodes of a PBS job

        ``$ qsub <your-params-of-qsub> -- `which pbsdsh` hq worker start``

    * Manual request in SLURM

      - Start worker on the first node of a Slurm job

        ``$ sbatch <your-params-of-sbatch> --wrap "hq worker start"``

      - Start worker on all nodes of a Slurm job

        ``$ sbatch <your-params-of-sbatch> --wrap "srun hq worker start"``

    * Automatic submission of workers into PBS/SLURM

      - Slurm:

        ``$ hq alloc add slurm --partition <partition>``

      - PBS:

        ``$ hq alloc add pbs --queue <queue>``


* Monitor the state of jobs

  ``$ hq jobs``
