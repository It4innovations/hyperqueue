//! This module controls autoalloc (automatic allocation), a background process that queues jobs
//! into PBS/Slurm in response to user requirements and task workload to provide more workers for
//! the HQ runtime.
//!
//! The term `allocation` represents a PBS/Slurm job in this module, to distinguish itself from
//! HQ jobs.
